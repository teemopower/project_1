Project 1

Technoologies used:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Phaser.io

Best experiences:

- Phaser offers a lot of tools to perform otherwise difficult tasks

Worst experiences:

- It was hard to research how to implement Phaser, for example, how to go in between screens (main menu, instructions, etc.)
- Trying to implement animations since you need to create sprite sheets

If I had more time:

- more animations
- more characters
- more special moves and movements
- touchscreen capatibility
